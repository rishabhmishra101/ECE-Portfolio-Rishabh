# Rishabh’s Electronics Engineering Journey

Welcome to my learning portfolio.  
I am an Electronics and Communication Engineering student building my foundation in embedded systems, digital design, robotics basics, and hardware–software integration.

This repository is not a showcase of perfection — it is a record of steady progress.  
I update it at my own pace, especially during exams or heavy academic periods.

---

## 🎯 Current Learning Directions
These are the areas I am actively exploring at a beginner level:

- Embedded systems (C, microcontrollers, hardware interaction)
- Digital design fundamentals (logic circuits, truth tables)
- Robotics basics (sensors, actuators, simple autonomous behavior)
- MATLAB basics (signal visualization and simple analysis)

I am focusing on **building hands-on intuition first**, and refining theory as I grow.

## 📁 What This Repository Contains
This repo will gradually include:

- Small MATLAB experiments  
- Digital logic simulations  
- Beginner embedded code examples  
- Notes and summaries of what I learn  
- Mini-projects and experiments  
- Reflections on challenges and improvements  

The goal is to make learning **visible, consistent, and practical**.

## 🛠️ Skills I Am Building
(Current stage: beginner → improving)

- C programming for embedded systems  
- Python basics  
- Arduino / microcontroller fundamentals  
- Understanding of logic gates and circuit behavior  
- Debugging simple circuits  
- MATLAB basics for signal visualization  

My focus is on **small wins** that build confidence and momentum.

## 🌱 Mindset & Approach
I learn best through:

- Hands-on experiments  
- Breaking concepts into small, manageable steps  
- Reflecting on mistakes without self-pressure  
- Celebrating progress, even when small  

This repository helps me stay grounded, organized, and consistent.

## 📌 Future Additions (Planned but not rushed)
- LED blink and sensor-based embedded programs  
- Basic robotics experiments  
- MATLAB scripts for simple signal operations  
- Circuit simulations using Tinkercad / LTspice  
- Documenting each project with notes and results  

As my engineering understanding grows, this repository will grow with me.
